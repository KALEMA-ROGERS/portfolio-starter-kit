Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing the healthcare landscape. From predictive analytics to personalized medicine, AI-powered tools are helping doctors diagnose diseases faster, optimize treatment plans, and improve patient outcomes.

## Key Applications
- **Medical Imaging:** AI algorithms can detect anomalies in X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans with high accuracy.
- **Virtual Health Assistants:** Chatbots and voice agents provide 24/7 support, answer patient queries, and schedule appointments.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Machine learning models forecast patient risks, hospital readmissions, and disease outbreaks.

## Challenges
Despite its promise, AI in healthcare faces challenges such as data privacy, bias in algorithms, and the need for robust validation.

## The Future
As AI continues to evolve, it will empower clinicians and patients alike, making healthcare more efficient, accessible, and personalized.
